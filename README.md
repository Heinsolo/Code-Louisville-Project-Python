# Code-Louisville-Project-Python

This project serves as my final capstone project for the May 2o19 Code Louisville Python Class.

The database I chose was a listing of the top selling video games. My inquires included which publishers had the most top selling games, and of those publishers, which platforms were featured the most of the top selling games.

There is a Jupyter Notebook inside the repository which will include all of the code and Seaborn visuals to show my findings. There should also be a CSV file in the repository that will load in with the Jupyter Notebook.

If you have any issues with loading my project, please email me at jacob.hein77@gmail.com or call me at 502-648-0396. Thanks!

Jacob Hein
